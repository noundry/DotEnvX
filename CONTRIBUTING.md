## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DotEnvX.git
cd DotEnvX
```

2. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```

4. Install the CLI tool locally:
```bash
cd DotEnvX.Tool
dotnet pack
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./nupkg DotEnvX.Tool
```

## Coding Guidelines

### C# Style

- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add encryption support for vault files

- Implement vault file format
- Add VaultEncryption service
- Update CLI commands

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high code coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

Example:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Parse_WithValidEnvContent_ReturnsExpectedDictionary()
{
    // Arrange
    var content = "KEY=value\nANOTHER=test";
    
    // Act
    var result = DotEnvParser.Parse(content);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal("value", result["KEY"]);
    Assert.Equal("test", result["ANOTHER"]);
}
```

## Areas Needing Help

We're particularly interested in contributions in these areas:

- **Performance optimizations** - Improving parse speed and memory usage
- **Additional encryption algorithms** - Supporting more encryption methods
- **Cloud integrations** - Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
- **IDE extensions** - VS Code, Visual Studio extensions
- **Documentation** - Tutorials, guides, API documentation
- **Internationalization** - Multi-language support for CLI
- **Bug fixes** - Especially parser edge cases

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers in `.csproj` files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create a release tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`
4. Push to GitHub: `git push origin v1.0.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically publish to NuGet
